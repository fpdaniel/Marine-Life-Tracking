# Marine-Life-Tracking

This application's purpose is to keep track of animals seen in different marine environments and locations. It is fairly minimal at the moment and is not a completed project. This application was initially started because we needed to make something for a class.

We were supposed to use open source software and libraries to develop our application, and so we did.

This application was written using Python 3.6.

The libraries/modules used in this program are:
- matplotlib
- sqlite3
- tkinter
